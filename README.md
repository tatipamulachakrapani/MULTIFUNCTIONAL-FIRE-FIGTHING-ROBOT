Introducing an autonomous firefighting robot designed for fire detection and suppression, equipped with smoke and flame sensors for quick hazard identification. Controlled by an Arduino microcontroller, it communicates through SMS to promptly alert designated contacts upon fire detection. The robot's primary focus is quick and accurate identification of fire hazards in diverse environments, activating its sprinkler system to rapidly deploy water upon detecting flames. The integration of a camera allows real-time visual observation of the fire scene, enhancing situational awareness. With sensors, GSM module, camera the robot becomes a multifunctional solution for remote firefighting, providing rapid response to incidents, alerting authorities, and mitigating risks to life and property. This technology aims to revolutionize fire incident management, reducing response times, improving safety measures, and enhancing emergency response protocols. The ultimate goal is an effective remote firefighting solution that minimizes potential hazards to human life and property.
